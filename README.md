# PDF Spaced Repetition

I don't know what to call this. The idea is to make something very similar to the pdf reader demonstrated in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFuu4pesKf0) by Andy Matuschak.

## FAQ

- Why Spaced Repetition?
  - I'm procrastinating actually studying and reading textbooks in favor of building "productivity systems".
  - No, but really, I think this will make it easier for me develop a deeper understanding of the material and retain it for longer. By "the material" I mean whatever I consider imporant or interesting enough to want to learn or study.
- Can I use this?
  - Once it's done, yes. That is if you like buggy software written solely for one person. You can fork it and modify it to your heart's content, or use it as is.
- Why is the code so unbelievably ugly and misorganized?
  - It's all AI generated.
    - I almost certainly could do this quicker and cleaner if I wrote at least some of it myself, but I made a bet to do it solely with LLMs.
- Why not just make the flashcards in Anki?
  - I didn't want to.
